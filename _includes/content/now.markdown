A list of things I am currently working on:

- Improving my javascript skills.
- [Contributing](https://github.com/alexcarpenter#contributions-calendar) as much as I can to Open Source projects.
- Creating documentation for [ButaneCSS](https://github.com/ButaneCSS/butanecss).
- Reading "[Ready Player One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4WKUQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)".
- Practicing meditation using [Calm](http://www.calm.com/).
