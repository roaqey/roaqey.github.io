A list of things I am currently working on:

- Improving my javascript programming skills.
- Reading The Census Taker by China Mi√©ville.
- Reading The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kondo.
- Practicing meditation using [Calm](http://www.calm.com/).
