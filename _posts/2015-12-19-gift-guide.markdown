For those last minute gift ideas I thought I would put together a small list of some of my favorite tools and toys for 2015. Most of them are pretty small and everyday carry items that I usually have on me at all times.

### [Trove Slim Wallet][trove]
First off is my wallet. My wife got me the Trove Wallet last year for christmas and it has quickly become my favorite wallet I have ever owned. I only carry 4 to 5 cards with me and the Trove Wallet is very slim but sturdy.

### [Fischer Space Pen][fischer]
I write down notes throughout the day at work and having a pen on your person at all times is important. The Fisher Space Pen is not the best pen but its size is what makes it great. Fits in my pocket without me knowing its there.

### [Field Notes Pack][fieldnotes]
Everyone likes Field Notes. They are a great size and I keep one in my back left pocket always. Moleskin produces a very similar product but the different varieties that Field Notes produces are always fun.

### [Fenix E05 Flashlight][fenix]
It is that time of the year where you to head to and from work in the dark. Having a pocket flashlight is always helpful and extremely nerdy I know. I just picked up the Fenix E05 and it is amazing how much light a tiny AAA LED flashlight can produce.

### [Offscreen Magazine Subscription][offscreen]
I finally got my hands on a copy of Offscreen this year. Spending most of my days on the computer it is nice to sit back on the couch and dive into a quality magazine with some great interviews.

### [Hubsan X4 Quadcopter Toy Drone][drone]
This is one gift I have on my list this year. I have always liked RC toys growing up and these drones look like a lot of fun to fly around the house.

Happy holidays!
