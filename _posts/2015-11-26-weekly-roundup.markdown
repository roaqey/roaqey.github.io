### [The Cost of Frameworks Recap](https://css-tricks.com/the-cost-of-frameworks-recap/)
Some interesting conversations going on about the performance costs of relying on frameworks. Worth a read to get a grasp around the effects of using a framework instead of beginning from scratch.

### [Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
If you work in the command line often throughout your day it is worth investing some time into customizing it to optimize your workflow. The easiest way to do this that I have found is Oh-my-zsh. It is hosted on Github and the instruction work as expected. I also suggest using iTerm2 instead of the default Terminal. More on why in the future.

### [Jekyll 3 Released](https://jekyllrb.com/news/2015/10/26/jekyll-3-0-released/)
I love Jekyll and it is exciting to see a new release. There are a few things I would love to see but it is a really great platform for a small personal site with a blog.

### [CSS writing-mode vertical](http://codepen.io/alexcarpenter/full/LpaXKb/)
I never knew about this CSS feature. I am seeing more and more vertical type on the web and this might be a good solution. It also has pretty good browser compatibility.

### [Bob Ross Ipsum Generator](http://lifehacker.com/bob-ross-ipsum-generates-dummy-text-with-happy-little-p-1743785185)
Who doesn't need a little more Bob Ross in their life?

### [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen)
I, like half of the internet was a little disappointed to find out about Rdio shutting its doors. In search of another service to fill its void and reluctant to switch to Spotify I settled upon Google Music. So far I am really happy with that decision.
